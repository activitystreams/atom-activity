    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Atom Syndication Format, as defined in <xref
      target="RFC4287"></xref>, is widely used to transmit various types of
      web content such as weblog posts, news headlines, as well as user
      activities within social sites. In the case of user activities, Atom
      lacks the ability to express much of the activity-specific metadata in a
      machine-parseable format. Activity Streams is an XML format designed to
      allow this additional activity metadata to be expressed within existing
      Atom entries and feeds.</t>

      <t>It is a goal of this specification to provide sufficient metadata
      about an activity such that a consumer of the data can present it to a
      user in a rich human-friendly format. This may include constructing
      readable sentences about the activity that occurred, visual
      representations of the activity, or combining similar activities for
      display.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>This document refers to elements in a number of XML namespaces as
      defined in <xref target="xml-names"></xref>. For brevity, these elements
      shall be referred to using prefixes rather than their full namespace
      URIs. The aliases used within this document are listed in the following
      table. The choices of namespace prefix are arbitrary and are not
      semantically significant.</t>

      <t>This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
      Infoset <xref target="xml-infoset"></xref>. The phrase "Information
      Item" is omitted when naming element and attribute information items.
      Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
      referring to an element information item in infoset terms. Likewise,
      when this specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to an
      attribute information item.</t>

      <t>This specification allows the use of IRIs <xref
      target="RFC3987"></xref>. Every URI <xref target="RFC3986"></xref> is
      also an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is named. When an IRI
      that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to
      a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC3987"></xref>.
      When an IRI is serving as an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.</t>

      <t>The text of this specification provides the sole definition of
      conformance. Examples in this specification are non-normative.</t>

      <t>This specification uses "the Atom specification" to refer to <xref
      target="RFC4287"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="concepts" title="Activity Concepts">
      <t>In its simplest form, an activity consists of an actor, a verb, and
      an object. It tells the story of a person performing an action on or
      with an object -- "Geraldine posted a photo" or "John shared a video".
      In most cases these elements will be explicitly declared, but they may
      also be implied.</t>

      <section anchor="activity" title="The Activity Construct">
        <t>An activity consists of the following logical components:</t>

        <section anchor="activity.time" title="Time">
          <t>A Date Construct, as defined in section 3.3 of <xref
          target="RFC4287"></xref>, that identifies the time at which the
          activity occurred. It is important to note that this is not
          necessarily the same as the time at which the activity was
          published. An Activity construct MUST have exactly one Time
          value.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.actor" title="Actor">
          <t>An <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> that identifies
          the entity that performed the activity. An Activity construct MUST
          have exactly one actor.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.verb" title="Verb">
          <t>A URI value that identifies the action of the activity.  This URI
          MUST be an absolute URI, or a URI relative to the base URI of
          <spanx style="verb">http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/</spanx>.  An
          Activity construct MUST have exactly one verb.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.object" title="Object">
          <t>This <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> identifies the
          primary object of the activity. An Activity construct MUST have
          exactly one object.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.target" title="Target">
          <t>The target of an activity is an <xref target="object">Object
          Construct</xref> that represents the object to which the activity
          was performed. The exact meaning of an activity's target is
          dependent on the verb of the activity, but will often be the object
          of the English preposition "to". For example, in the activity "John
          saved a movie to his wishlist", the target of the activity is
          'wishlist'. The activity target MUST NOT be used to identify an
          indirect object that is not a target of the activity. An Activity
          construct MAY have a target but it MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.title" title="Title">
          <t>An HTML representation of the natural language title for this
          activity. Consumers MAY use the value of this field, if set, as a
          fallback for when the provided verb is not recognized. An
          Activity Construct MAY have a title but it MUST NOT have more than
          one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.summary" title="Summary">
          <t>An HTML representation of a natural language describing this
          activity including visual elements such as thumbnails. Consumers MAY
          use the value of this field, if set, as a fallback for when
          the provided verb is not recognized. An Activity Construct MAY have a
          summary but it MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="object" title="The Object Construct">
        <t>An object construct is a thing, real or imaginary, which
        participates in an activity. It may be the entity performing the
        activity, or the entity on which the activity was performed. An object
        consists of the logical components defined in the following sections.
        Certain object types may further refine the meaning of these
        components, or they may define additional components. If an object
        type defines an additional component then it SHOULD also define the
        representation of that component in one or more serialization
        formats.</t>

        <section anchor="object.id" title="ID">
          <t>The id of an object construct is an absolute URI that uniquely
          identifies the object. An Object construct SHOULD have exactly one
          ID value. If an object construct does not have an ID value consumers
          MAY use the <xref target="object.permalink">Permalink URL</xref> as
          a weaker identifier, but must in this case allow for the fact that
          Permalink URL is not defined to be unique across all objects and be
          prepared to handle duplicates.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.name" title="Name">
          <t>This string value provides a human readable display name for the
          object, if the object has a name. An Object construct MAY have a
          name, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.summary" title="Summary">
          <t>This string value provides a human readable description or
          summary of the Object. An Object construct MAY have a summary, but
          MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.image" title="Representative Image">
          <t>This URI value identifies an image resource which provides a visual
          representation of the object, intended for human consumption. An Object
          construct MAY have a representative image, but MUST NOT have more than
          one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.permalink" title="Permalink URL">
          <t>This URI value identifies a resource which provides an HTML
          representation of the object. An Object construct MAY have a
          Permalink URL, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.object-type" title="Object Type">
          <t>A URI value that identifies the type of object.  This URI
          MUST be an absolute URI, or a URI relative to the base URI of
          <spanx style="verb">http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/</spanx>.  An
          Object construct MAY have a type, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>

          <t>If no object type is present, the object has no specific type.
          Consumers SHOULD refer to such objects only by their names. For
          example, when forming an activity sentence a consumer might say
          "Johan posted 'My Cat'" rather than "Johan posted a photo: 'My
          Cat'".</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Atom Representation">
      <t>Activities can be represented in an Atom document using a combination
      of conventions and custom extension elements. Activities are represented
      using atom:entry elements but may exist in one of two forms, an Activity
      Entry or an Object Entry.</t>

      <section anchor="activityasentry"
               title="Activity represented as atom:entry">
        <t>Any valid Atom entry as defined by section 4.1.2 of <xref
        target="RFC4287"></xref> is a representation of one or more activities
        as defined in <xref target="activity"></xref>.</t>

        <t>If the atom:entry contains at least one activity:object element
        then it is a Full Activity Entry and MUST be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="fullactivityentry"></xref>. Otherwise the entry is an
        Implied Activity Shorthand Entry and MUST be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="impliedactivityentry"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Although there is not a one-to-one mapping between an Atom entry
        and an activity, consumers SHOULD retain the value of the atom:id
        element from which each activity was produced such that these
        activities can be identified should an entry be referred to by another
        Atom feature which is not aware of the activity streams data model
        defined in this specification. This id is not unique across all
        activities and has no semantic significance for Activity Streams
        processing.</t>

        <section anchor="fullactivityentry" title="Full Activity Entry">
          <t>A Full Activity Entry represents a selection of one or more
          Activity Constructs which have differing Objects but all share the
          same values for the other Activity Construct properties. An activity
          is produced for each <spanx style="verb">activity:object</spanx>
          child element of the Full Activity Entry. In this section, "the
          entry" shall refer to the <spanx style="verb">atom:entry</spanx>
          element that is a Full Activity Entry.</t>

          <t>The components of the Activity Constructs are represented in a
          Full Activity Entry as follows:</t>

          of each entry is the title of an object rather than a sentence
          describing an activity.</t>

    <section anchor="rss2representation" title="RSS 2.0 Representation">
      <t>Activities can be represented in an RSS 2.0.11 document, as defined
      by <xref target="RSS2"></xref>, using a combination of conventions and
      custom extension elements. An activity is represented using an RSS
      "item" element. The RSS serialization only supports a subset of the
      activity data model allowing descriptions of simple activities that have
      only a verb and an object. This serialization is optimized for posting
      activities describing the creation of new objects. Publishers with a
      need for representing other fields that are not catered for by this
      serialization are recommended to use the Atom serialization instead for
      best results. This RSS serialization is defined only as a means for
      those already publishing streams of objects as RSS to produce minimally
      useful list of activities for activity-aware consumers.</t>

      <t>A specific RSS document has a single activity actor that applies to
      all activities it represents. This actor has no known id, name, url or
      object type but it is assumed that all activities in the feed share the
      same actor and therefore consumers MAY use information obtained from
      another source, such as the user account which is assumed to be the
      subject of the feed, to populate these properties.</t>

        <t>An RSS "item" element represents exactly one Activity Construct in
        terms of its object. The item actually directly represents both the
        Object Construct that is the object of the Activity Construct and the
        Activity Construct itself via different subsets of the child
        elements.</t>

      <t>Publishers or Consumers implementing Activity Streams as a stream of

      malicious user input such as cross-site scripting attacks are not

      <t>Consumers that re-emit ingested content to end-users MUST take
      reasonable measures if emitting ingested content to make sure
      potentially malicious ingested input is not re-emitted.</t>

      <t>Consumers that re-emit ingested content for crawling by search
      engines should take reasonable measures to limit any use of their site

          <postamble>This example shows a typical activity entry using the
          post verb defined by this specification and a hypothetical "photo"
          object type. It also demonstrates the use of atom:title and
          atom:content to provide fallback content for feed processors that do
          not support activity extensions. An activity stream application
          might render this entry into the sentence "Geraldine posted a photo
          titled 'My Cat' in Geraldine's Photos", with the photo title and the
          source feed title presented as links.</postamble>

          <postamble>Example: An activity entry showing the use of the actor,
          verb, object and target elements. Also illustrated is the use of
          multiple objects in a single activity entry, which serves as a
          shorthand for publishing multiple consecutive activities with the
          same verb and target.</postamble>

          <postamble>This example shows an object entry describing the object
          referred to in the activity from <xref
          target="activityentryexample"></xref>. That example would also be an
          acceptable implied post activity for this entry, assuming that this
          entry were in a feed whose attributes match those of the atom:source
          in the activity entry example.</postamble>
